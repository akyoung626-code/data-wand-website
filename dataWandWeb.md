# DataWand Website Brief for Agency Partner

## What is DataWand?

**The Simple Pitch:**
DataWand turns paper forms into digital data using your iPhone camera. No typing. No cloud. Just magic.

**The Grandpa Explanation:**
You know how you fill out paper forms at the doctor's office, then someone has to type all that information into a computer? DataWand skips the typing. You take a picture with your iPhone, and it reads the handwriting and fills in the computer form automatically. Like a magic wand for paperwork.

## The Magic Numbers

```
0 Servers — Everything happens on YOUR devices. No cloud. No strangers seeing your data.

1 Form — Snap a photo of any paper form. That's it.

2 Clicks — Connect your iPhone to Chrome, and you're done.
```

## Product Components

1. **iPhone App** — Uses Apple's built-in Vision AI to read handwriting (no internet needed)
2. **Chrome Extension** — Receives the extracted text and auto-fills web forms
3. **Direct Connection** — iPhone talks to Chrome over your WiFi. No middleman. No servers.

## Why It's Special

- **Privacy by Design** — Your data never leaves your devices. Period.
- **Works Offline** — OCR happens on the iPhone itself
- **Template Magic** — Set up a form once, reuse it forever
